TODO
----
- Finish layer with complete functionality of density based clustering.
- Finish client file for embedding a web application into the framework.
This also refers to making the framework completely UI driven.
- Add a modular atmosphere to the framework with more embeddings, but with
the use of less third parties. This can include things like more search
options for detecting hotspots, and possible modules for the UI such as
trending hotspots.
