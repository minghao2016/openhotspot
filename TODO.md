#TODO
- Add a modular atmosphere to the framework with more embeddings, but with
the use of less third parties. This can include things like more search
options for detecting hotspots (k-means, etc), and possible modules for the
UI such as trending hotspots.
- Begin working on/eventually finish model which is the actual prediction file.
- Start working on Qt GUI which should add a better and easier way of interacting
with the framework.
- Turn predicted coordinates or predicted clusters into an exact address.
