#TODO
- Finish dbscan with complete functionality of density based clustering.
- Finish client file for embedding a web application into the framework.
This also refers to making the framework completely UI driven.
- Add a modular atmosphere to the framework with more embeddings, but with
the use of less third parties. This can include things like more search
options for detecting hotspots (k-means, etc), and possible modules for the
UI such as trending hotspots.
- Begin working on/eventually finish model which is the actual prediction file.
